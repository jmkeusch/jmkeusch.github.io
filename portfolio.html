    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I work in technology and am working on developing a more technical background. I have worked on web apps throughout my career and am very interested in formalizing knowledge and 
      web engineering experience. This is my sixth class at Tufts so I have some C++ experience and some Python experience from a previous Data Science bootcamp with General Assembly.

    <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <a href="https://www.bistrotducoin.com/">Bistrot du Coin</a>
    <p>This is an American-French bistro-style restaurant in my neighborhood in Washington, DC. It features some classic decor like the white-and-red checkered table cloths and vintage <i>accoutrement</i>
      on the walls and ledges. You'll see a variety of people there, including some of the neighborhood's French speakers. Bistro du Coin is a great place to celebrate a birthday while being conveniently
      located and reasonably priced.

        Following our theme, beef bourguignon is also a French-American style dish featuring beef and vegetables braised in a red wine-based stew. It's an amazing dish to serve in the fall and winter
        with rich flavor that will fill the house with an excellent aroma. It can be served over mashed potatoes or egg noodles and goes great with the wine you used in the stew!
