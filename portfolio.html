    <h2>About Me</h2>
    I work in technology and am working on developing a more technical background. I have worked on web apps throughout my career and am very interested in formalizing knowledge and 
    web engineering experience. This is my sixth class at Tufts so I have some C++ experience and some Python experience from a previous Data Science bootcamp with General Assembly.
